Calculate your one rep max easily with this app

This app allows you to find out your one rep max for the Bench Press, Deadlift, and Squat without the need to actually perform your one-rep max. 

All you need to do is complete an AMRAP set. AMRAP = As Many Reps As Possible with a weight(w) where 75% <= w < 100% of your max.

Once that set is completed, you put your the weight lifted and reps performed into the app and you will get your approximate one-rep max. This app is indeed universal for those who use Lbs(pounds) or KGs(kilograms).
